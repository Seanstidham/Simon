Notes for the project cause I was losing points for adding the notes to the startup readme


updated html link

pretty much just going to be adding comments while i break down the code bit by bit and see what its doing on all the JS files

after looking at the code notes:
- use the prinicples of the login.js to make a proper login screen
- use scores.js to leanr how to store data and call on that data
